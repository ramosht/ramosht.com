  "description": "At Plegia I work as a full-stack developer, developing new features and maintaining the existing ones, for both apps (Admin Panel for internel process and the application used by the candidates). I work mostly with NestJS with Postgres in the back-end and with Next.js with Tailwind CSS in the front-end. But I also had experience with Heroku, Segment (CPD) and Scrum methodology. Here I have the pleasure of being part of a team of many great developers with whom I have the opportunity to always learn and grow."
