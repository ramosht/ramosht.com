  "description": "At the beginning of the pandemic, I had the opportunity to be a volunteer in a project called Missão Covid (Mission Covid), which intended to provide free doctor appointments for anyone who had symptoms of Covid-19. A few months later, this project became Starbem and I was invited to integrate the first team. At Starbem I worked mostly with React Native (w/ Typescript) to develop the mobile app, but also worked on the web application used by the doctors. Here I had a great experience in building a mobile app from scratch."
